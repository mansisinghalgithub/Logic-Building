class Q1{
	
	public static void main(String args[]){

	int i=10;

	while(i<5){

	i++;

	System.out.println(i);

	}

	}

}


Ans= In the following question, the value of i is initialised wrong because when i=10 the loop will not getting executed(as i<5). Therefore, there is no output of the written code.
